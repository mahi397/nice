Hereâ€™s a more detailed and actionable breakdown for **frontend** and **backend** developers for the application. Each feature is described with the specific implementation steps required for both teams to collaborate effectively and meet the objectives efficiently:

---

### **Passenger Features**

#### 6. Schedule Trips
**Backend Tasks:**
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /trips` to create trips.
  - `PUT /trips/:id` to update existing trips.
  - `GET /trips/:id` to fetch details of a specific trip.
